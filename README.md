# First-Projects
### First two programming projects by Zay Tsu and Abasiama Akpan

### Project 1: GUI for energy project evaluation

### Project Duration: Mar 2018 – Apr 2018

### File name: peval.rkt

Project description: This racket program is built to analyze the economic condition of
an oil well and determine its profitability. The major calculations
implemented in this program were done to drive the decision to invest
in the drilling and completion of the well. These calculations are: the oil
reserve estimation over the life of the field, the net present value of the
oil and gas well, the production rates per day and tertiary recovery
implementation impacts on the economic analysis. In order to achieve
the above calculations, production data was converted into a CSV file
for better compatibility with racket. The building blocks for the data
analysis involved a comprehensive implementation and manipulation of
lists and some higher order functions. The racket plot libraries were
used to create plots for data visualization and a GUI was created for a
more user-friendly software.


### Project 2: Neato Robot Vacuum Cleaner Hack

### Project Duration: Mar 2018 – Apr 2018

### File name: final_C_project.c

Project description: This C Program enables a robot to find a wall, follow a wall and
escape through the door using 3-D lidar sensor data. In order to achieve this, a communication
protocol in a sense has to be established between computer and robot
through a USB. In addition, a text file is created from the C program and data
is visualized by reading and writing into this created file. The C program
is also written to manipulate 3-D lidar sensor data
order to allow the robot to make key decisions like calculating the
distance of a door and avoid hitting an obstacle straight on. Some
limitations of the robot are: Assuming the classroom is empty when the
robot tries to escape and the only escape route is by finding a wall. The
robot is also limited to movement only and the door is assumed to be
open at all times.
